O | Now O | the O | pain B-Symptom | has O | gone O | into O | my O | shoulder B-Symptom | and O | upper O | arm O | on O | my O | left O | side O | . O | Just O | last O | week O | I O | noticed O | my O | right O | arm O | is O | tight B-Symptom | also O | . O | I O | can't O | sleep O | on O | either O | shoulder B-Symptom | now O | .

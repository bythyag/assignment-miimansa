BIO Sequence:
I O | started O | experiencing O | severe B-Symptom | leg B-Symptom | cramping I-Symptom | at O | night O | with O | the O | pain B-Symptom | traveling I-Symptom | to O | my O | buddocks B-Symptom | and O | stomach B-Symptom | as O | well O | . O | The O | pain O | was O | so O | bad O | I O | could O | not O | get O | out O | of O | the O | bed O | and O | had O | to O | crawl O | to O | get O | to O | the O | bathroom O | to O | take O | Advil B-Drug | . O | I O | asked O | my O | doctor O | what O | could O | have O | caused O | this O | and O | he O | said O | it O | was O | probably O | from O | the O | Lipitor B-Drug | . O | Recently O | I O | experienced O | extreme B-Symptom | stomach B-Symptom | pain I-Symptom | that O | stretched O | to O | my O | side B-Symptom | and O | back B-Symptom | . O | The O | stomach O | pain O | came O | suddenly O | and O | it O | would O | come O | and O | go O | for O | a O | week O | before O | it O | became O | so O | bad O | I O | could O | not O | sleep O | . O | I O | had O | just O | gotten O | over O | a O | urinery B-Disease | tract I-Disease | infection I-Disease | ( O | one O | of O | the O | side-effects B-ADR | ) O | and O | I O | thought O | it O | had O | returned O | but O | the O | symptoms O | were O | different O | . O | I O | still O | had O | the O | urge O | to O | urinate O | constantly O | but O | it O | would O | come O | and O | go O | and O | I O | would O | have O | no O | symptoms O | for O | a O | day O | then O | it O | would O | return O | again O | . O | I O | remembered O | reading O | the O | phamplet O | that O | comes O | with O | the O | prescription O | drugs O | and O | it O | mentioning O | some O | of O | symptoms O | that O | I O | was O | experiencing O | . O | I O | stopped O | taking O | the O | Lipitor B-Drug | for O | a O | day O | and O | I O | did O | not O | have O | any O | more O | stomach B-Symptom | pain O | or O | urgency O | . O | I O | also O | had O | been O | experiencing O | lack O | of O | energy B-Symptom | for O | quite O | some O | time O | and O | I O | attributed O | this O | to O | stress O | but O | after O | reading O | this O | website O | I O | feel O | it O | was O | due O | to O | the O | Lipitor B-Drug | also O | . O | I O | don O | ' O | t O | think O | I O | will O | take O | this O | drug O | anymore O | and O | since O | I O | read O | that O | taking O | vitamin B-Drug | C I-Symptom | can O | help O | you O | with O | your O | cholesterol O | I O | think O | I O | will O | try O | this O | method O | instead O | . O | I O | think O | there O | should O | be O | a O | better O | alternative O | to O | lowering O | cholesterol O | than O | such O | a O | potent O | drug O | that O | can O | cause O | so O | many O | side O | effects I-ADR | . O | I O | don O | ' O | t O | want O | to O | be O | a O | case-study O | when O | they O | finally O | take O | this O | drug O | off O | the O | market O | . O |

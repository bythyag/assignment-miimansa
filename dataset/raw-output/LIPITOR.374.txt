This O | is O | the O | same O | poster O | as O | the O | previous O | posting O | . O | I O | notice O | a O | poster O | attributed O | Bell's B-Disease | palsy I-Disease | to O | lipitor B-Drug | . O | I O | too O | had O | Bell's B-Disease | , O | I O | went O | back O | and O | looked O | at O | my O | cholesterol O | chart O | and O | found O | I O | got O | Bell's B-Disease | before O | I O | started O | on O | lipitor B-Drug | . O | There O | seems O | to O | be O | a O | consistent O | occurence O | of O | muscle B-Symptom | pain I-Symptom | and O | / O | or O | liver B-Disease | problems O | but O | I O | wonder O | how O | many O | other O | problems O | are O | not O | really O | attributable O | to O | lipitor B-Drug | eg O | see O | my O | Bell's B-Disease | palsy I-Disease | . O | Also O | I O | get O | night O | muscle B-Symptom | cramps I-Symptom | but O | I O | have O | had O | occasional O | muscle B-Symptom | cramps I-Symptom | at O | night O | since O | I O | was O | a O | child O | , O | Maybe O | my O | memory O | isn't O | as O | good O | as O | it O | was O | but O | I'm O | 70 O | and O | I O | still O | passed O | one O | of O | the O | hardest O | bar O | exams O | in O | the O | country O | less O | than O | 2 O | years O | ago O | . O | However O | I O | don't O | doubt O | that O | some O | unlucky O | people O | are O | having O | bad O | side B-ADR | effects I-ADR | , O | I O | just O | wonder O | about O | some O | of O | the O | more O | esoteric O | ones O | .

O | This O | website O | has O | been O | an O | absolute O | lifeline O | for O | me O | . O | My O | doctor O | had O | seemed O | so O | completely O | unwilling O | to O | accept O | that O | my O | symptoms O | could've O | possibly O | been O | related O | to O | my O | taking B-Drug | Lipitor I-Drug | .

O | Be O | very O | careful O | and O | very O | informed O | before O | you O | start O | any O | new O | medication O | . O | Don't O | always O | trust O | the O | word O | of O | your O | doctor O | as O | the O | only O | word O | and O | take O | it O | at O | its O | face O | value O | . O | When O | it O | comes O | to O | your O | body O | , O | you O | have O | every O | right O | to O | dictate O | , O | understand O | , O | and O | call O | the O | shots O | about O | what O | does O | and O | does O | not O | go O | in O | to O | it O | .

Slight O | muscle O | soreness B-Symptom | in O | arms B-Symptom | and O | legs B-Symptom | . O | Major O | sorness B-Symptom | in O | knees B-Symptom | and O | elbows B-Symptom | . O | I O | have O | gout B-Disease | and O | had O | been O | attributing O | the O | joint B-Symptom | pain I-Symptom | to O | that O | , O | but O | after O | bloodwork O | , O | my O | rheumatologist O | said O | it O | was O | not O | gout O | ! O | I O | have O | an O | appt. O | scheduled O | to O | start O | to O | deal O | with O | this O | pain O | but O | an O | experience O | last O | night O | and O | reading O | some O | postings O | on O | this O | site O | are O | leading O | me O | to O | suspect O | the O | lipitor B-Drug | . O | My O | usual O | 20mg B-Drug | dose O | is O | taken O | with O | dinner O | , O | but O | I O | had O | forgotten O | to O | take O | it O | and O | remembered O | just O | before O | bedtime O | . O | I O | awoke O | at O | 3AM O | with O | an O | a O | knee B-Symptom | that O | was O | just O | throbbing O | with O | pain I-Symptom | . O | I O | hobbled O | to O | the O | bathroom O | and O | took O | a O | dose O | of O | Advil B-Drug | and O | was O | able O | to O | get O | back O | to O | sleep O | after O | about O | a O | half O | hour O | . O | I O | awoke O | this O | morning O | with O | about O | a O | 50% O | reduction O | in O | pain O | and O | it O | seems O | to O | have O | subsided O | as O | the O | day O | goes O | on O | . O | I O | will O | never O | take O | lipitor B-Drug | before O | bed O | again O | , O | I O | may O | cut O | the O | daily O | dose O | in O | half O | and O | possibly O | stop O | altogether O | if O | the O | pain O | persists O | at O | an O | intolerable O | level O | . O | Lipitor B-Drug | has O | lowered O | my O | cholesterol B-Disease | levels O | to O | the O | 180's O | . O | I O | had O | never O | had O | a O | reading O | below O | 218 O | in O | my O | life O | and O | it O | has O | been O | steadily O | rising O | over O | the O | last O | few O | years O | to O | a O | consistent O | level O | in O | the O | 240's O | . O | The O | ratio O | of O | bad O | to O | good O | cholesterol O | is O | in O | the O | acceptable O | zone O | and O | never O | had O | been O | before O | taking O | lipitor B-Drug | . O | So O | , O | all O | in O | all O | , O | the O | lipitor B-Drug | has O | done O | a O | good O | job O | . O | I O | will O | try O | to O | cope O | with O | the O | joint B-Symptom | pain I-Symptom | , O | but O | if O | it O | becomes O | a O | constant O | problem O | , O | I O | will O | have O | to O | stop O | taking O | the O | drug O | .

Within O | a O | week O | or O | two O | of O | taking O | the O | prescribe O | dose O | , O | I O | began O | developing O | something O | I O | never O | had O | before O | : O | eczema B-Disease | . O | It O | became O | progressively O | worse O | , O | and O | by O | the O | end O | of O | the O | first O | month O | had O | created O | a O | massive O | triangular O | rash B-Symptom | on O | my O | forehead O | , O | as O | well O | as O | a O | patch O | on O | one O | cheek O | . O | The O | skin O | was O | very O | red O | and O | rough O | , O | and O | made O | public O | life O | miserable O | and O | embarassing O | . O | I O | stopped O | taking O | Lipitor B-Drug | and O | the O | rash O | cleared O | up O | greatly O | , O | but O | has O | NEVER O | gone O | away O | completly O | , O | flaring O | up O | slightly O | from O | time O | to O | time O | , O | but O | not O | nearly O | as O | bad O | as O | it O | was O | during O | dosing O | with O | Lipitor B-Drug | . O | I O | was O | not O | taking O | any O | other O | medications O | at O | the O | time O | , O | and O | never O | had O | eczema B-Disease | before O | . O | The O | anti-lipid O | effect O | of O | Lipitor B-Drug | was O | unusually O | strong O | in O | my O | case O | , O | causing O | my O | CHO B-Symptom | to O | drop O | below O | 90 O | ( O | from O | a O | baseline O | of O | over O | 200 O | ) O | . O | by O | the O | end O | of O | the O | first O | 2 O | weeks O | of O | dosing O | , O | my O | physician O | had O | me O | cutting O | the O | smallest O | dose O | tablet O | in O | half O | to O | be O | taken O | once O | a O | day O | . O | Even O | so O | , O | the O | rash O | continued O | to O | enlarge O | and O | get O | worse O | , O | so O | I O | was O | forced O | to O | stop O | taking O | the O | Lipitor B-Drug | . O

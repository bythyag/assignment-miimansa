O | ago O | , O | I O | decided O | to O | tell O | my O | Dr O | I O | was O | having O | muscle B-Symptom | pain I-Symptom | and O | leg B-Symptom | cramps I-Symptom | . O | He O | switched O | to O | Pravachol B-Drug | 20mg O | . O | I O | lasted O | about O | 2 O | weeks O | . O | The O | pain O | was O | worse O | . O | Then O | I O | decided O | to O | look O | on O | the O | internet O | to O | find O | out O | what O | was O | causing O | the O | pain O | . O | It O | was O | Statin B-Drug | . O | I O | looked O | that O | up O | and O | found O | what O | it O | does O | to O | the O | body O | . O | So O | , O | I O | decided O | to O | stop O | taking O | any O | drug O | and O | take O | some O | Q10 B-Drug | to O | build O | my O | body O | back O | up O | . O | Two O | months O | later O | went O | back O | on O | Lipitor B-Drug | with O | the O | Q10 I-Drug | . O | 2 O | months O | later O | , O | the O | pain O | was O | back O | . O | Twice O | as O | bad O | as O | before O | , O | plus O | a O | whole O | bunch O | of O | other O | side B-ADR | -effects I-ADR | , O | you O | see O | I O | 'm O | seriuosly O | allergic O | to O | the O | Statin B-Drug | . O | And O | I O | know O | now O | , O | why O | I O | should O | have O | known O | this O | , O | but O | no O | one O | told O | me O | about O | it O | . O | When O | you O | are O | taking O | Statin B-Drug | and O | drink O | alcohol B-Drug | the O | side B-ADR | -effects I-ADR | increase O | dramatically O | . O | When O | ever O | I O | drank O | , O | sipped O | a O | little O | wine O | , O | by O | body O | hurt O | so O | bad O | , O | I O | thought O | I O | had O | the O | flu O | . O | And O | no O | Aleve B-Drug | , O | or O | pain B-Symptom | killer I-Symptom | would O | help O | . O | I O | thought O | I O | was O | allergic O | to O | the O | alcohol O | . O | But O | now O | I O | know O | it O | was O | the O | Statin B-Drug | . O | Here O | are O | a O | list O | of O | the O | side-effects B-ADR | I O | had O | , O | that O | started O | slowly O | and O | in O | two O | years O | , O | became O | unbearable O | : O | Insomina B-ADR | , O | abnoraml B-ADR | dreams I-ADR | , O | depression B-ADR | , O | memory B-ADR | loss I-ADR | , O | photosensitivity B-ADR | , O | muscle B-ADR | pain I-ADR | , O | leg B-ADR | cramps I-ADR | , O | rhinitis B-ADR | , O | bronchitis B-ADR | , O | asthma B-Disease | , O | dry B-ADR | skin I-ADR | , O | tinnitus B-ADR | ( O | left O | ear O | ) O | taste B-ADR | loss I-ADR | , O | dry B-ADR | eyes I-ADR | , O | weight B-ADR | gain I-ADR | and O | finally O | hypertension B-Disease | . O | During O | the O | two O | years O | , O | I O | was O | on O | the O | Lipitor B-Drug | , O | all O | these O | syptoms B-Symptom | started O | out O | slowly O | . O | First O | came O | the O | tinnitus B-ADR | . O | My O | Dr O | sent O | me O | to O | the O | ear O | Dr O | .

O | Then O | came O | the O | sinus O | problems O | , O | Dr O | put O | me O | on O | Rhinocort B-Drug | . O | During O | all O | this O | I O | felt O | like O | I O | was O | 80 O | years O | old O | . O | My O | neck O | hurt O | , O | my O | hips O | hurt O | . O | We O | got O | a O | $ O | 3,000.00 O | sleep O | by O | number O | bed O | to O | relieve O | the O | pain O | . O | Didn O | 't O | really O | help O | . O | Insomia B-ADR | was O | constant O | . O | I O | got O | hooked O | on O | Tylenol B-Drug | PM O | . O | I O | gained O | a O | lot O | of O | weight O | . O | Went O | to O | Lindora B-Drug | to O | loss O | weight O | , O | so O | I O | could O | get O | off O | the O | Lipitor B-Drug | . O | Lost O | 40 O | lbs O | . O | Dr O | said O | to O | stay O | on O | Lipitor B-Drug | for O | prevention O | . O | This O | is O | when O | I O | decided O | to O | check O | it O | out O | on O | the O | internet O | . O | When O | I O | went O | back O | on O | the O | Lipitor B-Drug | , O | about O | 2 O | months O | ago O | , O | I O | had O | a O | small O | drink O | of O | wine O | at O | a O | wedding O | . O | That O | night O | my O | body O | aches O | were O | so O | bad O | , O | I O | could O | hardly O | stand O | it O | . O | Then O | two O | days O | later O | I O | came O | down O | with O | bronhitis B-Disease | , O | and O | asthma B-Disease | . O | I O | have O | asthma B-Disease | anyway O | , O | but O | it O | was O | the O | worse O | case O | I O | 've O | had O | in O | 13 O | years O | . O | Then O | I O | had O | sinus O | problems O | again O | . O | My O | Dr O | took O | x-rays O | for O | pneumonia B-Disease | and O | sinus O | infection O | , O | Came O | back O | clear O | . O | My O | Dr O | wanted O | me O | to O | see O | an O | ear O | nose O | and O | throat O | Dr O | . O | Then O | my O | blood O | pressure O | went O | up O | to O | 198/90 O | . O | I O | have O | never O | in O | my O | life O | had O | high B-Disease | blood O | pressure O | . O | Dr O | put O | me O | on O | Norvasc B-Drug | . O | Then O | I O | had O | two O | horrible O | nightmares O | . O | I O | finally O | , O | went O | on O | the O | internet O | and O | looked O | at O | side O | effects O | for O | Lipitor B-Drug | . O | When O | I O | saw O | all O | the O | side-effects B-ADR | , O | I O | nearly O | died O | . O | I O | have O | all O | the O | syptoms B-Symptom | . O | I O | stopped O | taking O | Lipitor B-Drug | that O | instant O | . O | That O | was O | one O | week O | ago O | . O | I O | 'm O | starting O | feel O | a O | little O | better O | . O | I O | 've O | gone O | to O | my O | Dr O | and O | asked O | him O | if O | he O | new O | about O | the O | alcohol O | related O | problem O | . O | He O | said O | , O | no O | . O | There O | is O | no O | warning O | on O | the O | prescription O | bottle O | , O | to O | tell O | you O | to O | watch O | out O | for O | a O | reaction O | with O | alcohol O | . O | The O | Dr O | is O | now O | doing O | tests O | , O | to O | see O | if O | there O | has O | been O | any O | damage O | to O | my O | heart O | and O | muscles O | . O | I O | also O | , O | asked O | for O | physical O | theraphy O | for O | my O | left O | shoulder O | and O | neck O | . O | My O | left O | shoulder O | is O | almost O | immobile O | . O | I O | think O | the O | tinnitus B-ADR | in O | my O | left O | ear O | has O | been O | caused O | by O | the O | Lipitor B-Drug | . O | I O | hope O | it O | goes O | away O | soon O | . O | I O | also O | , O | lost O | my O | sense O | of O | taste O | during O | this O | whole O | thing O | . O | I O | would O | recommend O | anyone O | who O | has O | experienced O | any O | side O | effects O | increased O | by O | alcohol O | , O | to O | consider O | an O | allergic O | reaction O | to O | the O | drug O | . O | Dr O | was O | thinking O | about O | putting O | on O | another O | Statin B-Drug | drug O | . O | I O | said O | , O | don O | 't O | you O | get O | it O | , O | I O | 'm O | allergic O | to O | it O | . O

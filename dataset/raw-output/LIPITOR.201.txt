Just O | before O | this O | last O | Christmas O | I O | had O | a O | small O | stroke B-Disease | and O | spent O | three O | days O | in O | the O | hospital O | . O | To O | make O | a O | long O | story O | short O | , O | there O | are O | no O | after O | effects O | of O | the O | stroke B-Disease | . O | In O | other O | words O | the O | symptoms B-Symptom | went O | away O | . O | But O | , O | my O | Doc O | put O | me O | on O | Aggrenox B-Drug | and O | 20mg O | of O | Lipitor B-Drug | . O | I O | have O | very O | high O | arches O | and O | have O | had O | a O | little O | tingling B-Symptom | in O | my O | feet O | for O | years O | . O | This O | is O | really O | helped O | with O | a O | good O | arch O | support O | . O | But O | for O | the O | last O | two O | months O | the O | pain B-Symptom | in O | my O | feet O | and O | calves O | ( O | and O | sometimes O | thigh B-Symptom | ) O | has O | gotten O | much O | worse O | . O | I O | cannot O | walk O | very O | far O | and O | sleeping O | has O | become O | a O | problem O | because O | of O | the O | pain B-Symptom | . O | Because O | of O | the O | preexisting O | arch O | problem O | , O | I O | thought O | it O | was O | just O | naturally O | getting O | worse O | but O | after O | finding O | this O | web O | site O | I O | am O | not O | sure O | if O | it O | is O | not O | the O | Lipitor B-Drug | . O | On O | a O | pain O | scale O | it O | has O | gone O | from O | a O | 1 O | or O | 2 O | to O | 7 O | or O | 8 O | . O | I O | have O | a O | followup O | appointment O | with O | my O | Doctor O | in O | two O | days O | and O | was O | thinking O | of O | asking O | him O | if O | I O | could O | go O | off O | the O | Lipitor B-Drug | . O | What O | do O | you O | think O | ? O |

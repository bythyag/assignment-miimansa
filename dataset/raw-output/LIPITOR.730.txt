My O | Prostate B-Disease | Oncologist I-Disease | prescribed O | 10 B-Drug | mg O | per O | day O | for O | high O | LDL B-Disease | . O | The O | first O | day O | I O | did O | my O | normal O | exercise O | routine O | , O | ran O | two O | miles O | , O | lifted O | weights O | , O | etc O | That O | night O | I O | had O | neck B-Symptom | pain I-Symptom | , O | and O | thought O | it O | was O | nothing O | . O | Took O | the O | second O | tablet O | the O | next O | day O | . O | Upon O | arising O | on O | the O | second O | day O | , O | I O | noticed O | that O | I O | was O | very O | tired B-Symptom | . O | Pain B-Symptom | or O | cramping B-Symptom | in O | both O | quads O | ( O | above O | knee O | , O | back O | of O | leg O | ) O | . O | I O | was O | not O | motivated O | to O | do O | anything O | . O | Spent O | most O | of O | the O | day O | in O | bed O | , O | reading O | a O | book O | , O | something O | I O | rarely O | do O | . O | By O | the O | afternoon O | I O | could O | barely O | function O | . O | Felt O | generally O | terrible O | , O | flu B-Symptom | like O | symptoms O | , O | lower B-Symptom | back I-Symptom | ache I-Symptom | , O | irritable B-Symptom | , O | no O | motivation O | , O | and O | pain B-Symptom | in O | knuckles O | , O | neck B-Symptom | , O | and O | both O | upper B-Symptom | legs I-Symptom | . O | I O | had O | a O | worse O | headache B-Symptom | than O | usual O | ( O | I O | have O | migraine B-Disease | ) O | , O | but O | who O | knows O | ? O | Went O | to O | the O | internet O | and O | found O | this O | site O | . O | Saw O | Lipitor B-Drug | commercial O | on O | TV O | warning O | about O | muscle B-ADR | pain I-ADR | . O | I O | did O | not O | take O | the O | tablet O | today O | , O | and O | I O | am O | feeling O | better O | . O | I O | attribute O | the O | condition O | to O | the O | Lipitor B-Drug | , O | although O | there O | is O | no O | proof O | . O | I O | am O | a O | prostate B-Disease | cancer I-Disease | patient O | and O | take O | a O | number O | of O | other O | drugs O | , O | which O | raise O | the O | LDL B-Disease | . O | Apparently O | , O | some O | ( O | a O | few O | ) O | patients O | cannot O | tolerate O | this O | drug O | . O | I O | note O | that O | there O | are O | some O | on O | this O | list O | who O | have O | permanent O | damage O | , O | so O | it O | is O | serious O | for O | some O | of O | us O | . O | My O | legs O | are O | still O | sore O | , O | and O | feel O | worse O | than O | they O | did O | after O | a O | day O | of O | aggressive O | downhill O | skiing O | a O | week O | ago O | . O | Apparently O | this O | works O | for O | most O | , O | but O | some O | people O | have O | a O | severe O | and O | not O | so O | obvious O | reaction O | . O | Stop O | immediately O | if O | there O | is O | any O | muscle B-ADR | pain I-ADR | . O |

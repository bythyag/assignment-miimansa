O | He O | read O | an O | article O | about O | Baycor B-Drug | , O | Lipitor I-Drug | , O | etc O | . O | We O | asked O | his O | M.D. O | about O | this O | & O | he O | told O | us O | that O | the O | side O | effects O | of O | Lipitor I-Drug | were O | an O | INFLAMMATORY B-ADR | muscle O | weakness I-ADR | & O | degeneration B-ADR | . O | With O | my O | coaxing O | & O | the O | Dr's O | okay O | my O | day O | stopped O | Lipitor I-Drug | for O | one O | month O | . O | His O | legs O | did O | not O | get O | better O | OR O | worse O | . O | The O | Dr's O | have O | him O | so O | worried O | about O | his O | cholesterol O | that O | he O | started O | taking O | it O | again O | . O | He O | is O | now O | so O | debilitated O | , O | he O | was O | using O | a O | walker O | , O | & O | his O | wheelchair O | is O | being O | delivered O | today O | .

O | He O | is O | losing O | the O | feeling O | in O | his O | right O | hand O | and O | the O | inability B-Symptom | to O | perform O | fine O | motor O | skills O | . O | With O | all O | the O | tests O | he O | has O | had O | to O | rule O | out O | other O | causes O | , O | it O | seems O | that O | Lipitor I-Drug | is O | the O | culprit O | .

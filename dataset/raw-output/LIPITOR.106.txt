Rough O | anxiety B-Symptom | and O | paranoia B-Symptom | . O | To O | be O | fair, O | I O | must O | note O | that O | I O | was O | also O | taking O | Norvasc B-Drug | - O | a O | blood O | pressure O | pill O | and O | when O | the O | above O | symptoms B-Symptom | persisted O | I O | stopped O | Norvasc B-Drug | at O | once O | ( O | replaced O | with O | Diovan B-Drug | ) O | . O | However, O | at O | that O | time O | - O | over O | a O | month O | ago O | - O | I O | was O | only O | aware O | of O | Norvasc B-Drug | 's O | side O | effects O | and, O | indeed, O | when O | I O | stopped O | taking O | it O | most O | of O | the O | anxiety B-Symptom | and O | paranoia B-Symptom | symptoms B-Symptom | disappeared O | - O | most, O | but O | not O | all O | . O | That O | is O | when O | I O | started O | looking O | for O | the O | other O | culprit O | . O | Sure O | discovered O | it O | soon: O | Lipitor B-Drug | . O | Spoke O | to O | a O | psychiatrist O | and O | she O | confirmed O | that O | the O | entire O | family O | of O | Norvasc B-Drug | ( O | called O | amlodipine B-Drug | ) O | is O | known O | to O | have O | psychiatric O | side O | effects O | . O | A O | month O | ago O | my O | family O | physician O | confirmed O | that O | Lipitor B-Drug | is O | guilty O | of O | similar O | symptoms B-Symptom | and O | agreed O | to O | let O | me O | off O | it O | for O | three O | months O | , O | until O | I O | take O | my O | next O | blood O | test O | . O | Meanwhile O | I'm O | now O | on O | health O | food O | as O | well O | as O | Q10 B-Drug | , O | Omega III B-Drug | , O | Nosterol B-Drug | and O | Vitamin E B-Drug | ( O | 200IU O | ) O | . O | I O | now O | hope O | that O | LDL O | is O | low O | enough O | to O | say O | to O | Lipitor B-Drug | goodbye O | . O | Time O | will O | tell O | . O

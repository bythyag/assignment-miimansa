O | More O | problems O | with O | my O | sinuses B-Disease | . O | Woke O | up O | with O | severe B-Symptom | vertigo I-Symptom | , O | but O | it O | may O | be O | due O | to O | a O | cold B-Disease | virus I-Disease | .

O | However, O | I O | didn O | 't O | have O | side B-ADR | effects I-ADR | from O | any O | of O | those O | medications O | . O | When O | I O | started O | Lipitor B-Drug | , O | Immediately O | had O | lower B-Symptom | back I-Symptom | pain I-Symptom | , O | then O | pain O | in O | my O | thighs I-Symptom | ( O | muscle B-Symptom | cramping I-Symptom | ) O | .

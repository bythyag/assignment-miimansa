I O | did O | not O | experience O | any O | , O | but O | only O | took O | 1 O | tab O | once O | a O | day O | for O | two O | days O | . O | I O | found O | that O | Voltaren B-Drug | took O | away O | all O | my O | pain B-Symptom | , O | i O | rarely O | use O | pain B-Symptom | relief I-Symptom | because O | i O | find O | it O | never O | helps O | or O | takes O | too O | long O | to O | take O | affect O | and O | just O | " O | soldier O | on O | " O | . O | As O | i O | am O | only O | young O | and O | relatively O | healthy O | i O | did O | not O | experience O | any O | side B-ADR | effects I-ADR | . O | HOWEVER O | my O | parents O | both O | have O | had O | bad O | side B-ADR | effects I-ADR | .

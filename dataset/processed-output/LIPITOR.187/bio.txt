O | Doctors O | unable O | to O | connect O | the O | dots O | ( O | Lipitor B-Drug | = O | above O | symptoms O | ) O | . O | Sure O | it O | lowered O | my O | cholesterol O | . O | But O | at O | what O | cost O | ? O | I O | told O | my O | doctor O | I O | was O | feeling O | weak B-Symptom | . O | He O | commented O | I O | see O | NO O | reason O | for O | you O | to O | be O | weak I-Symptom | ( O | Even O | though O | he O | prescribed O | the O | Lipitor B-Drug | for O | me O | ) O | Well O | needless O | to O | say O | that O | was O | the O | last O | time O | I O | saw O | him O | . O | I O | thought O | I O | had O | MS B-Disease | , O | Lupus B-Disease | , O | Fibromyalgia B-Disease | or O | some O | other O | illness O | that O | has O | the O | symptoms O | I O | was O | experiencing O | .

O | By O | the O | way O | . O | my O | new O | doctor O | had O | prescribed O | an O | anti-depressent B-Drug | for O | me O | . O | I O | never O | filled O | it O | , O | as O | my O | instincts O | told O | me O | it O | was O | something O | more O | .

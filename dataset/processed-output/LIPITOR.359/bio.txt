I O | used O | to O | take O | Provachol B-Drug | ( O | sp O | ? O | ) O | but O | I O | found O | it O | caused O | extreme O | bloating B-ADR | . O | It O | also O | seem O | to O | increase O | my O | heart O | rate O | therefore O | could O | not O | sleep O | well O | .

O | I O | will O | go O | for O | a O | blood O | test O | within O | a O | few O | days O | so O | we O | ' O | ll O | see O | how O | good O | it O | did O | its O | job O | . O | As O | far O | as O | side O | effects O | are O | concerned O | , O | I O | find O | that O | Lipitor B-Drug | also O | causes O | bloating B-ADR | and O | a O | great O | deal O | of O | gas B-ADR | build O | up O | although O | not O | as O | badly O | as O | my O | previous O | medication O | .

O | I O | first O | attributed O | this O | to O | work O | stress O | because O | I O | do O | a O | great O | deal O | of O | computer O | work O | . O | I O | thought O | perhaps O | that O | I O | was O | getting O | tendonitis B-Disease | looking O | at O | th O | . O | I O | have O | begun O | to O | take O | charge O | of O | fighting O | back O | against O | the O | side O | effects O | and O | have O | been O | taking O | multivitamins B-Drug | , O | B O | complex B-Drug | , O | CoQ10 B-Drug | , O | and O | GasX B-Drug | for O | bloating B-ADR | .

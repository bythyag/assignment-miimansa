Have O | suffered O | from O | leg B-Symptom | cramps I-Symptom | (principally O | at O | night O) | since O | beginning O | 40 B-Drug | mg O | Lipitor I-Drug | , O | 5 O | years O | ago O | , O | after O | a O | mild B-Disease | heart I-Disease | attack I-Disease | . O | Cardiologist O | offered O | no O | suggestions O | . O | After O | trying O | numerous O | recommendation O | for O | this O | problem O | such O | as O | potassium B-Drug | , O | magnesium B-Drug | , O | vitamin B-Drug | E I-Drug | , O | etc O | with O | no O | effect O | , O | my O | family O | doctor O | suggested O | that O | I O | stop O | taking O | Lipitor B-Drug | for O | 3 O | days O | , O | and O | see O | if O | it O | has O | any O | effect O | . O | The O | effect O | was O | dramatic O | . O | The O | cramps B-ADR | did O | not O | occur O | during O | the O | night O | after O | I O | did O | not O | take O | the O | 40 B-Drug | mg O | with O | my O | dinner O | . O | They O | also O | did O | not O | occur O | on O | the O | following O | two O | nights O | . O | I O | did O | not O | want O | to O | restart O | the O | Lipitor B-Drug | (once O | a O | day O | with O | the O | evening O | meal O) | for O | fear O | that O | the O | cramps B-ADR | would O | just O | as O | quickly O | return O | . O | Since O | it O | was O | possible O | that O | the O | reason O | why O | the O | night O | cramps B-Symptom | ceased O | so O | quickly O | is O | that O | I O | was O | taking O | the O | 40 B-Drug | mg O | entirely O | in O | the O | evening O | , O | I O | decided O | to O | split O | the O | pills O | and O | take O | half O | in O | the O | morning O | and O | half O | in O | the O | evening O | . O | Although O | some O | mild B-ADR | cramping I-ADR | did O | return O | , O | it O | was O | nowhere O | close O | to O | what O | I O | had O | been O | experiencing O | , O | and O | this O | has O | c O | .

SEVERE O | FATIGUE B-Symptom | IN O | MY O | BODY O | AND O | TIREDNESS B-Symptom | AND O | MUSCLE B-Symptom | PAINS I-Symptom | IN O | MY O | HIPS O | THAT O | CONTINUE O | TO O | THIS O | DAY O | AFTER O | BEING O | OFF O | THE O | DRUG O | FOR O | ALMOST O | A O | YEAR O | . O | DO O | NOT O | TAKE O | THIS O | DRUG O | !!!!! O | . O | I O | was O | put O | on O | this O | drug O | by O | my O | doctor O | for O | my O | somewhat O | high O | cholesterol B-Disease | . O | The O | next O | day O | , O | after O | starting O | this O | drug O | , O | I O | suddenly O | felt O | like O | I O | had O | aged O | to O | eighty O | years O | old O | overnight O | but O | did O | not O | connect O | it O | to O | starting O | Lipitor B-Drug | . O | Up O | until O | the O | start O | of O | this O | drug O | I O | felt O | that O | I O | was O | as O | young O | as O | I O | was O | in O | my O | twenties O | and O | wondered O | if O | this O | is O | how O | you O | might O | start O | feeling O | the O | affects O | of O | age O | , O | by O | waking O | up O | one O | morning O | and O | feeling O | all O | that O | age O | caught O | up O | with O | you O | and O | now O | you O | were O | older O | than O | your O | years O | . O | I O | took O | the O | drug O | for O | two O | terrible O | months O | and O | then O | had O | a O | blood O | test O | and O | my O | cholesterol B-Disease | had O | dropped O | . O | My O | doctor O | mailed O | me O | the O | results O | of O | my O | blood O | test O | but O | did O | not O | send O | me O | a O | new O | prescription O | like O | he O | had O | the O | last O | time O | so O | I O | did O | not O | know O | that O | he O | wanted O | me O | to O | get O | it O | refilled O | . O | So O | I O | went O | off O | of O | Lipitor B-Drug | and O | within O | two O | months O | I O | was O | feeling O | normal B-Symptom | again O | and O | even O | took O | a O | job O | with O | the O | post O | office O | where O | I O | walked O | five O | miles O | a O | day O | with O | no O | problem O | . O | I O | did O | not O | associate O | my O | getting O | better O | with O | my O | coming O | off O | Lipitor B-Drug | , O | unfortunately O | . O | Then O | I O | had O | an O | appointment O | with O | my O | doctor O | and O | he O | said O | I O | should O | have O | refilled O | that O | prescription O | by O | calling O | his O | office O | . O | So O | I O | did O | and O | the O | next O | day O | , O | after O | taking O | only O | one O | pill O | , O | I O | was O | eighty O | years O | old O | again O | . O | This O | time O | I O | did O | associate O | it O | with O | the O | start O | of O | Lipitor B-Drug | and O | then O | read O | the O | warnings O | the O | drug O | store O | gives O | you O | with O | meds O | and O | found O | that O | my O | symptoms B-ADR | were O | the O | same O | as O | what O | they O | warned O | against O | . O | I O | am O | not O | a O | hypochondriac O | and O | I O | never O | read O | those O | warnings O | so O | this O | was O | not O | a O | head O | thing O | . O | I O | immediately O | went O | off O | the O | drug O | but O | a O | year O | later O | I O | am O | still O | have O | the O | same O | eighty O | years O | old O | feeling O | and O | do O | not O | know O | that O | I O | will O | ever O | be O | normal B-Symptom | again O | . O | I O | do O | not O | understand O | how O | just O | one O | pill O | can O | do O | that O | and O | this O | time O | I O | am O | not O | recovering O | like O | I O | did O | the O | first O | time O | . O | This O | has O | ruined O | my O | life O | and O | I O | would O | never O | have O | taken O | Lipitor B-Drug | if O | I O | knew O | what O | I O | know O | now O | and O | I O | am O | so O | sorry O | that O | I O | ever O | heard O | of O | this O | drug O | . O | This O | is O | so O | severe O | that O | I O | think O | taking O | it O | for O | even O | a O | short O | time O | can O | cause O | permanent O | damage O | . O | My O | doctor O | , O | when O | I O | told O | him O | of O | all O | this O | , O | wanted O | to O | change O | statins O | because O | he O | was O | still O | worried O | about O | my O | cholesterol B-Disease | . O | I O | told O | him O | no O | more O | statins O | and O | he O | then O | prescribed O | Zetia B-Drug | , O | which O | he O | said O | was O | less O | effective O | but O | was O | not O | a O | statin O | , O | which O | I O | am O | still O | afraid O | to O | take O | unless O | I O | improve O | from O | the O | affects O | of O | the O | Lipitor B-Drug | . O | He O | told O | me O | he O | was O | on O | Lipitor B-Drug | himself O | and O | that O | he O | had O | no O | problems O | but O | then O | said O | , O | well O | he O | did O | have O | neck O | pains B-ADR | that O | could O | have O | been O | a O | side O | affect O | , O | but O | that O | he O | had O | been O | on O | the O | drug O | two O | years O | before O | this O | developed O | . O | I O | told O | him O | of O | the O | information O | on O | this O | site O | that O | describes O | some O | people O | having O | that O | delayed O | reaction O | and O | I O | advised O | him O | to O | take O | himself O | off O | of O | this O | drug O | for O | a O | couple O | of O | weeks O | to O | see O | if O | the O | neck O | pains O | cleared O | up O | ! O | I O | advise O | , O | DO O | NOT O | TAKE O | THIS O | DRUG O | !!!!! O | . O |

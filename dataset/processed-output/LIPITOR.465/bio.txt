I O | started O | taking O | Lipitor B-Drug | after O | my O | cholesterol B-Disease | climbed O | to O | 310 O | . O | I O | Did O | not O | want O | to O | take O | it O | because O | I O | am O | a O | vegetarian O | , O | a O | health O | conscious O | person O | and O | dislike O | taking O | medicines O | , O | but O | my O | doctor O | , O | an O | endocrynologist B-Disease | , O | strongly O | recommended O | it O | . O | The O | first O | few O | months O | I O | was O | not O | aware O | of O | any O | side O | effects O | , O | but O | about O | a O | month O | ago O | I O | started O | to O | experience O | wrist B-Symptom | pain I-Symptom | , O | I O | thought O | it O | was O | my O | pilates B-Disease | class I-Disease | , O | but O | although O | I O | rested O | for O | 2 O | months O | from O | the O | class O | , O | the O | pain I-Symptom | continued O | . O | Then O | about O | two O | weeks O | ago O | , O | I O | got O | very O | bad O | cramps B-ADR | in O | my O | toes O | , O | they O | curled O | down O | and O | the O | pain I-Symptom | was O | terrible O | . O | About O | a O | week O | ago O | I O | was O | taking O | a O | bath O | and O | my O | muscles O | in O | my O | lower O | abdomen B-Disease | started O | to O | contract O | then O | the O | cramp I-ADR | got O | higher O | . O | I O | got O | scared O | that O | I O | was O | having O | something O | bad O | . O | After O | the O | cramps O | one O | night O | I O | had O | such O | tiredness B-Symptom | in O | my O | left O | leg O | that O | I O | could O | hardly O | walk O | , O | I O | thought O | that O | it O | was O | my O | high O | heels B-Disease | that O | I O | had O | worn O | all O | day O | . O | Then O | 2 O | days O | ago O | I O | woke O | up O | with O | a O | swollen B-ADR | foot I-ADR | , O | it O | was O | very O | painful I-ADR | to O | walk O | . O | That O | was O | it O | . O | I O | suspected O | that O | it O | was O | the O | Lipitor B-Drug | and O | came O | to O | the O | internet O | and O | read O | the O | same O | side O | effects O | in O | a O | lot O | of O | people O | posting O | their O | experiences O | with O | this O | drug O | . O | I O | even O | thought O | that O | I O | had O | ALS B-Disease | since O | a O | friend O | of O | mine O | died O | of O | it O | . O | It O | is O | amazing O | the O | amount O | of O | people O | that O | also O | thought O | the O | same O | in O | this O | list O | . O | Thanks O | God O | for O | the O | Internet O | . O | I O | stopped O | taking O | this O | medicine O | 2 O | days O | ago O | , O | I O | hope O | that O | I O | can O | get O | rid O | of O | these O | effects O | and O | that O | they O | are O | not O | permanent O | . O | I O | do O | not O | recommend O | it O | , O | unless O | it O | is O | life O | threatening O | and O | then O | only O | take O | it O | for O | a O | short O | time O | . O

Congestion B-Symptom | , O | cough B-Symptom | , O | elbows B-Symptom | burning B-Symptom | , O | right B-Symptom | heel B-Symptom | pain B-Symptom | , O | loss B-Symptom | of O | concentration B-Symptom | . O | I O | initially O | couldn't O | tell O | I O | was O | taking O | it O | . O | About O | two O | years O | ago O | I O | started O | waking O | up O | with O | significant O | congestion B-Symptom | with O | clear O | phlem B-Symptom | . O | Chest O | xray O | was O | clear O | . O | My O | doctor O | suspected O | allergies B-Disease | . O | Having O | 2 O | pets O | that O | seemed O | reasonable O | . O | About O | a O | year O | ago O | my O | elbows B-Symptom | would O | burn O | like O | fire O | at O | times O | when O | I O | rested O | my O | arms O | on O | a O | surface O | . O | This O | would O | come O | and O | go O | . O | I O | also O | began O | having O | trouble B-Symptom | focusing B-Symptom | while O | reading O | and O | would O | skip O | around O | . O | Two O | months O | ago O | my O | right B-Symptom | heel B-Symptom | became O | painful B-Symptom | for O | no O | reason O | . O | The O | more O | I O | walked O | on O | it O | the O | worse O | it O | felt O | . O | I O | switched O | shoes O | with O | no O | change O | . O | It O | hurt O | enough O | that O | I O | began O | to O | worry O | I O | might O | end O | up O | on O | disability B-Disease | if O | it O | got O | much O | worse O | . O | I O | was O | recently O | out O | of O | state O | for O | two O | weeks O | and O | still O | had O | congestion B-Symptom | in O | spite O | of O | being O | in O | a O | totally O | different O | environment O | . O | That O | was O | when O | I O | suspected O | the O | Lipitor B-Drug | and O | did O | some O | research O | on O | line O | and O | saw O | matches O | with O | all O | of O | my O | symptoms B-Symptom | . O | I O | immediately O | stopped O | it O | and O | the O | next O | morning O | the O | congestion B-Symptom | was O | 80% O | less O | . O | I O | saw O | my O | doctor O | who O | agreed O | I O | need O | to O | stop O | it O | . O | He O | explained O | that O | there O | are O | a O | lot O | of O | side O | affects B-ADR | and O | there O | is O | no O | way O | to O | predict O | who O | will O | get O | which O | ones O | or O | when O | they O | will O | develop O | .

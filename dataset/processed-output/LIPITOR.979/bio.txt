Swollen O | and O | stiff O | knees B-Symptom | and O | elbows B-Symptom | , O | mental B-Symptom | distress I-Symptom | , O | others O | that O | I O | am O | now O | only O | becoming O | aware O | of O | after O | reading O | many O | of O | these O | others O | testimonials O | . O | After O | being O | on O | Lipitor B-Drug | for O | 2 O | years O | my O | knees B-Symptom | and O | elbows B-Symptom | were O | getting O | increasingly O | stiff O | and O | sore B-Symptom | . O | I O | 'm O | a O | painter O | by O | trade O | and O | largely O | attributed O | it O | to O | over O | use O | of O | my O | joints O | . O | Repetitive B-Disease | stress I-Disease | syndrome I-Disease | . O | I O | went O | to O | my O | doctor O | , O | he O | sent O | me O | to O | an O | arthritis B-Disease | specialist I-Disease | , O | I O | had O | x-rays O | . O | nothing O | was O | found O | . O | I O | felt O | like O | an O | old O | ( O | older O | ) O | man O | during O | this O | period O | , O | I O | thought O | I O | was O | finished O | in O | terms O | of O | my O | trade O | and O | the O | things O | I O | enjoy O | most O | , O | like O | hiking B-Symptom | . O | My O | prescription O | of O | lipitor B-Drug | ran O | out O | a O | few O | months O | after O | these O | tests O | were O | done O | . O | I O | didn O | 't O | bother O | refilling O | it O | right O | away O | and O | noticed O | my O | knees B-Symptom | and O | elbows B-Symptom | felt O | better O | . O | I O | renewed O | the O | prescription O | and O | no O | sooner O | had O | I O | started O | taking O | it O | again O | that O | I O | felt O | the O | stiff O | joints O | return O | . O | So O | I O | stopped O | taking O | it O | , O | the O | stiffness O | goes O | away O | , O | started O | again O | , O | stiffness O | returns O | .

O | ( O | luckily O | since O | I O | live O | in O | Canada O | , O | these O | tests O | were O | all O | covered O | by O | our O | health O | care O | system O | ) O | I O | didn't O | make O | the O | connection O | to O | lipitor B-Drug | earlier O | because O | stiff O | , O | swollen O | joints O | were O | not O | listed O | as O | one O | of O | the O | side O | effects O | .

I O | stumbled O | across O | this O | website O | which O | was O | nothing O | short O | of O | a O | miracle O | to O | me O | . O | I O | was O | searching O | for O | answers O | on O | why O | I O | am O | in O | such O | pain B-Symptom | throughout O | my O | body O | , O | mental B-Symptom | confusion I-Symptom | at O | times O | and O | also O | short B-Symptom | term I-Symptom | memory I-Symptom | loss I-Symptom | which O | all O | seemed O | to O | be O | growing O | steadily O | worse O | for O | the O | past O | few O | years O | . O | I O | blamed O | it O | on O | stress B-Disease | ( O | with O | a O | dying O | husband O | ) O | , O | arthritis B-Disease | , O | advancing O | age O | etc O | and O | even O | discussed O | leg B-Symptom | pain I-Symptom | and O | body B-Symptom | cramps I-Symptom | with O | my O | doctor O | which O | he O | attributed O | chiefly O | to O | age O | and O | arthritis I-Disease | . O | I O | even O | had O | tests O | done O | on O | arteries O | to O | see O | if O | that O | could O | be O | the O | cause O | as O | I O | have O | an O | aortic B-Disease | aneurysms I-Disease | and O | thought O | perhaps O | my O | problems O | could O | be O | from O | poor O | circulation O | or O | blockage O | somewhere O | . O | They O | all O | checked O | out O | okay O | . O | It O | has O | been O | unbearable O | for O | several O | weeks O | now O | off O | and O | on O | and O | I O | suffered O | fatigue B-Symptom | , O | lack B-Symptom | of O | energy I-Symptom | and O | growing O | depression B-Symptom | and O | a O | feeling O | a O | fragility B-Symptom | where O | I O | had O | always O | been O | a O | strong O | woman O | until O | recent O | years O | . O | I O | looked O | up O | fibromyalgia B-Disease | thinking O | I O | might O | have O | that O | but O | when O | I O | casually O | looked O | up O | lipitor B-Drug | the O | ratings O | leaped O | out O | at O | me O | . O | These O | people O | all O | were O | experiencing O | my O | symptoms O | !!! O | THANK O | YOU O | for O | providing O | this O | web O | site O | it O | may O | very O | well O | have O | saved O | my O | life O | . O | I O | am O | contacting O | my O | doctor O | immediately O | and O | as O | of O | now O | no O | more O | lipitor B-Drug | . O | It O | did O | lower O | my O | cholestral B-Drug | but O | greatly O | lowered O | my O | quality O | of O | life O | and O | I O | guess O | I O | am O | going O | to O | do O | exercise O | and O | have O | joined O | weight O | watchers O | and O | see O | if O | I O | can O | control O | it O | in O | that O | manner O | . O | I O | am O | 67 O | and O | have O | been O | on O | Lipitor B-Drug | for O | several O | years O | with O | the O | symptoms O | growing O | steadily O | until O | now O | unbearable O | . O

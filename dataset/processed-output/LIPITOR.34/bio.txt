O | I O | am O | unable O | to O | move O | them O | in O | any O | direction O | but O | the O | normal O | motion O | . O | It O | has O | got O | to O | the O | point O | where O | turning O | over O | in O | bed O | wakes O | me O | up O | because O | of O | the O | pain B-Symptom | it O | causes O | . O | I O | have O | had O | a O | blood O | test O | to O | determine O | if O | Lipitor B-Drug | is O | causing O | this O | serious O | problem O | and O | the O | results O | said O | no O | it O | wasn't O | .

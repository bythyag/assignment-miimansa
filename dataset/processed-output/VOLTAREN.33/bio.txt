I O | have O | vaginal B-Symptom | bleeding I-Symptom | and O | cramping B-Symptom | . O | it's O | taken O | me O | almost O | a O | week O | to O | realize O | this O | bleeding B-ADR | is O | due O | to O | the O | medication B-Drug | . O | The O | bleeding O | started O | almost O | immediately O | after O | taking O | the O | first O | dose O | .

O | If O | anyone O | can O | give O | me O | info O | regarding O | how O | long O | this O | bleeding O | and O | cramping I-Symptom | lasts O | , O | I O | would O | appreciate O | it O | . O

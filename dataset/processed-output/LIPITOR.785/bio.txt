I O | female O | 5 O | feet O | 7 O | and O | a O | half O | inches O | tall O | 117 O | lbs O | . O | I O | do O | not O | smoke O | and O | have O | never O | smoked O | . O | I O | do O | not O | have O | high B-BloodPressure | blood I-BloodPressure | pressure I-BloodPressure | , O | nor O | have O | I O | ever O | had O | it O | . O | I O | am O | 45 O | and O | a O | half O | years O | old O | and O | was O | on O | 20 B-Drug | mg I-Drug | of O | Lipitor B-Drug | due O | to O | genetically O | high O | LDL B-Disease | for O | a O | period O | of O | seven O | months O | . O | At O | that O | point O | , O | I O | started O | having O | terrible B-ADR | , O | migratory B-ADR | joint I-ADR | pain I-ADR | all O | over O | my O | body O | that O | was O | very O | distinct O | and O | pronounced O | . O | I O | also O | had O | disabling B-ADR | fatigue I-ADR | and O | flu-like B-Symptom | malaise I-Symptom | . O | Some O | nights O | I O | would O | go O | to O | bed O | at O | 6 O | pm O | and O | not O | get O | up O | until O | 8 O | or O | 9 O | the O | next O | morning O | . O | I O | was O | quite O | ill O | . O | My O | doctor O | did O | tons O | of O | lab O | work O | to O | rule O | out O | things O | like O | rheumatoid B-Disease | arthritis I-Disease | , O | lupus B-Disease | , O | Lyme B-Disease | disease I-Disease | and O | active O | parvovirus B-Disease | infection I-Disease | . O | These O | all O | came O | back O | NEGATIVE O | . O | Finally O | , O | I O | was O | taken O | off O | Lipitor B-Drug | to O | see O | if O | the O | drug O | had O | anything O | to O | do O | with O | my O | symptoms O | . O | Within O | 72 O | hours O | I O | noted O | an O | improvement O | ; O | within O | seven O | days O | , O | the O | symptoms O | were O | completely O | gone O | and O | I O | was O | restored O | to O | health O | . O | I O | will O | not O | ever O | take O | Lipitor B-Drug | again O | as O | I O | believe O | it O | is O | liver-toxic B-ADR | and O | slowly O | poisons O | the O | patient O | . O | It O | did O | a O | great O | job O | of O | lowering O | my O | LDL B-Disease | ( O | 173 O | down O | to O | 60 O | ) O | . O | My O | total O | cholesterol O | went O | from O | 238 O | down O | to O | 143 O | . O | However O | , O | it O | nearly O | killed O | me O | in O | the O | process O | and O | I O | believe O | it O | is O | almost O | like O | a O | slow-acting O | poison O | . O |
